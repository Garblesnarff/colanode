 * @file Main entry point for type definitions within the `@colanode/client` package.
 *
 * This file re-exports various TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
 * used throughout the client-side application logic. These types help ensure
 * data consistency and provide strong typing for client operations, state management,
 * and communication with the server or local database.
 *
 * Organizing types here allows for a centralized and easily accessible collection
 * of all client-specific data structures.
