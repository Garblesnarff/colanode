# AI Integration Suite & Workflow Automation Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for enhancing the AI capabilities of Colanode and implementing a comprehensive workflow automation system. The enhancements include AI-powered content suggestions, intelligent document processing, AI-driven project management, and smart meeting notes, along with a built-in workflow automation engine similar to Zapier.

## 2. Architecture

```

### 2.1 Key Components

1. **AI Services Layer**: Extends existing AI capabilities with new features
2. **Workflow Engine**: New module for creating and executing automated workflows
3. **Trigger System**: Event-based system for initiating workflows
4. **Job Queue**: Enhanced job processing for workflow execution

## 3. Error Handling and Fallback Strategies

### 3.1 Graceful Degradation Modes

Each AI feature implements multiple fallback modes to ensure continued functionality even when primary AI services are unavailable:

1. **Content Suggestions**:
   - Primary: LLM-based contextual suggestions
   - Fallback 1: Rule-based suggestions using keyword matching
   - Fallback 2: Collaborative filtering based on similar users
   - Offline Mode: Recently accessed content suggestions

2. **Document Summarization**:
   - Primary: LLM-based intelligent summarization
   - Fallback 1: Extractive summarization using sentence scoring
   - Fallback 2: First and last paragraph extraction
   - Offline Mode: Pre-computed document outlines

3. **Task Prioritization**:
   - Primary: AI-driven priority scoring
   - Fallback 1: Rule-based prioritization (due dates, assignees)
   - Fallback 2: Simple chronological ordering
   - Offline Mode: Manual priority settings

4. **Meeting Notes**:
   - Primary: LLM-powered action item extraction
   - Fallback 1: Keyword-based item detection
   - Fallback 2: Speaker turn segmentation
   - Offline Mode: Manual note creation

### 3.2 Fallback to Simpler Heuristics

When LLMs fail or return poor results, the system automatically switches to heuristic-based approaches:

- **Keyword-based Analysis**: Use TF-IDF and keyword extraction for basic content understanding
- **Pattern Matching**: Apply regex patterns for structured data extraction
- **Statistical Methods**: Use frequency analysis for content categorization
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage similar user behavior for recommendations

### 3.3 User-Configurable AI Confidence Thresholds

Users can configure confidence thresholds for different AI features:

- **Low Threshold (0.3)**: Show all suggestions, even potentially irrelevant ones
- **Medium Threshold (0.6)**: Show only moderately confident suggestions
- **High Threshold (0.8)**: Show only highly confident suggestions

These thresholds are adjustable per feature and per user, with organization-wide defaults.

## 4. Cost Management

### 4.1 Usage Monitoring and Budgeting Controls

Implement comprehensive cost tracking and budgeting:

1. **Real-time Cost Tracking**:
   - Track API usage per provider (OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter)
   - Monitor usage by feature and user
   - Set up alerts for approaching budget limits

2. **Budget Allocation**:
   - Organization-level budgets
   - Team/department sub-budgets
   - Individual user quotas

3. **Cost Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Daily/weekly/monthly spending trends
   - Feature usage breakdown
   - Cost per user/team analysis

### 4.2 Smart Caching Strategy

Implement multi-level caching to minimize redundant AI requests:

1. **Result Caching**:
   - Cache AI-generated summaries for 24 hours
   - Cache content suggestions for 6 hours
   - Cache task extractions for 12 hours

2. **Context Caching**:
   - Cache document embeddings for 7 days
   - Cache user preference profiles

3. **Invalidation Strategy**:
   - Automatic cache invalidation on content changes
   - Manual cache clearing options
   - Time-based expiration policies

### 4.3 User Settings for AI Feature Frequency

   - Per-feature enable/disable toggles

2. **Sensitive Content Detection**:
   - Automatic detection of potentially sensitive content
   - User prompts for confirmation before processing
   - Content type classification (public/private/confidential)

### 5.2 Data Retention Policies

Implement clear data retention policies for AI-processed content:

- **Temporary Processing Data**: Retained for 30 days then deleted
- **Cached Results**: Retained for 90 days with automatic cleanup
